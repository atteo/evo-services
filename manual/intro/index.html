</h1>
<hr>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
Moonshine is a Java application framework. It integrates many technologies and libraries
needed for modern application development. Whether you are developing console program, web application or enterprise-ready
backend service, modular architecture of Moonshine allows you to build a solution that matches the complexity of your problem.
</p>

<h3 id="service">Service</h3>
<p>
Moonshine is based around the notion of a <a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/services/Service.html">Service</a>. Service is a distinct component
implementing a certain functionality. Services can then be instantiated and configured at runtime using a flexible configuration file.
Moonshine provides a lot of ready to use services and also forces you to modularize your application in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Moonshine, out of the box, provides services to start and configure
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jta/JtaService.html">transactions</a>,
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/database/DatabaseService.html">database access</a> with
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/liquibase/LiquibaseService.html">migrations</a>, persistence using
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/hibernate/HibernateService.html">Hibernate</a> and
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/springdata/SpringData.html">Spring Data</a>, two HTTP engines:
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jetty/JettyService.html">Jetty</a> and
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/tomcat/TomcatService.html">Tomcat</a>,
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/webserver/ServletContainer.html">servlets</a>,
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/websocket/WebSocketContainerService.html">websockets</a> and
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jersey/Jersey.html">REST services</a>. Additionally Moonshine contains
services which allow to <a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/perf4j/Perf4JService.html">profile</a> your application and collect
<a href="/apidocs/org/moonshine/metrics/Metrics.html">metrics</a> which can be retrieved directly using
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jmx/JMX.html">JMX</a> or through the provided
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jolokia/JolokiaService.html">REST wrapper</a> or
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/jminix/JMinix.html">web console</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>
Moonshine is built from the ground up with the focus on testability and test-driven development. Support for JUnit allows your tests
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/tests/MoonshineTest.html">to be executed inside a Moonshine container</a>. Network services were carefully
written to always start on a random port, so you can safely execute your tests in parallel. There is also support for
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/tests/MockAndBind.html">mocking</a> and
<a href="/apidocs/org/atteo/moonshine/webdriver/WebDriverService.html">testing web applications</a>.
